# Platform Specification Document: Nigeria Community-Based Procurement Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This specification document outlines the technical requirements and functional capabilities of the Community-Based Procurement Platform (CBPP) to be developed by ASOS Consulting. The platform will initially be implemented for the Nigerian Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) but is designed as a multi-tenant solution that can scale to support Federal, State, and LGA levels across multiple African countries. The platform will enable community-based organizations (CBOs) to participate in government procurement processes up to ₦50 million in value, in alignment with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's Renewed Hope Initiative.

### 1.2 Scope
The CBPP will be a comprehensive digital ecosystem that manages the end-to-end procurement process for projects implemented at various government levels. The platform will facilitate registration, qualification, and training of CBOs and Procurement Compliance Officers (PCOs), interface with budget systems through both API and manual import options, enable transparent procurement processes, and provide monitoring and reporting capabilities. The multi-tenant architecture will allow for customization to meet the specific needs of different government entities while maintaining a core set of features and compliance standards.

### 1.3 Definitions
