# Localization and Accessibility Strategy for CBPP

## Overview
The Community Based Public Procurement (CBPP) platform aims to be inclusive and accessible to all community members across Nigeria. This document outlines our strategy for implementing multi-language support and accessibility features.

## Supported Languages

| Language Code | Language Name | Native Name | Coverage |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| en | English | English | 100% (Default) |
| pcm | Nigerian Pidgin | Naija Pidgin | 100% |
| yo | Yoruba | Èdè Yorùbá | 100% |
| ha | Hausa | Harshen Hausa | 100% |
| ig | Igbo | Asụsụ Igbo | 100% |

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Technical Implementation

#### 1.1 Translation Framework
- Use `react-i18next` for React applications
- Implement language detection based on:
  - User preference (stored in profile)
  - Browser language
  - System settings
  - Geolocation (optional)

#### 1.2 File Structure
```
/src
  /locales
    /en
      common.json
      dashboard.json
      forms.json
    /pcm
      common.json
      dashboard.json
      forms.json
    /yo
      common.json
      dashboard.json
      forms.json
    /ha
      common.json
      dashboard.json
      forms.json
    /ig
      common.json
      dashboard.json
      forms.json
```

#### 1.3 Translation Keys Structure
```json
{
  "common": {
    "buttons": {
      "submit": "",
      "cancel": "",
      "save": ""
    },
    "navigation": {
      "dashboard": "",
      "projects": "",
      "contractors": ""
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. User Interface Considerations

#### 2.1 Language Selector
- Prominent language selector in the header
- Language names in their native script
- Language flags/icons (optional)
- Remember user's language preference
- Allow per-session language override

#### 2.2 RTL Support
- Although none of our initial languages require RTL, the system should be designed to support it for future expansion

#### 2.3 Content Adaptation
- Accommodate different text lengths
- Support for different date formats
- Support for different number formats
- Currency display in both Naira and local representations

### 3. Accessibility Features

#### 3.1 Technical Standards
- Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Support for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast mode
- Adjustable font sizes
- Focus indicators

#### 3.2 Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA labels
- Meaningful alt text for images
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Skip navigation links
- Form labels and descriptions

#### 3.3 Visual Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios meeting WCAG standards
- Text scaling without loss of functionality
- No essential information conveyed by color alone
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent navigation

### 4. Content Guidelines

#### 4.1 Translation Process
1. Create base content in English
2. Professional translation to supported languages
3. Community review for cultural appropriateness
4. Technical review for UI fit
5. User testing with native speakers

#### 4.2 Cultural Considerations
- Respect for local customs and traditions
- Appropriate imagery and icons
- Local date and time formats
- Local currency formats
- Cultural color considerations

#### 4.3 Content Types to Translate
- UI elements
- Error messages
- Help documentation
- Email notifications
- PDF reports
- Form labels and placeholders
- Validation messages
- System notifications

### 5. Testing Strategy

#### 5.1 Automated Testing
- Unit tests for translation loading
- Integration tests for language switching
- Accessibility automated testing (e.g., jest-axe)
- Visual regression tests for different languages

#### 5.2 Manual Testing
- Native speaker review
- Screen reader testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Mobile device testing
- Different browser testing

### 6. Performance Considerations

#### 6.1 Loading Strategy
- Lazy loading of language packs
- Caching of language resources
- Minimal initial bundle size
- Optimized font loading

#### 6.2 Metrics to Monitor
- Language pack load time
- Language switch response time
- Memory usage per language
- Cache hit rates
- User language preferences

### 7. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up i18n framework
- Implement language switching
- Create base English translations
- Implement accessibility basics

#### Phase 2: Core Languages (Week 3-4)
- Nigerian Pidgin translation
- Basic accessibility features
- User testing with Pidgin speakers
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 3: Additional Languages (Week 5-8)
- Yoruba translation
- Hausa translation
- Igbo translation
- Enhanced accessibility features

#### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 9-10)
- User testing with all language groups
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation updates

### 8. Maintenance and Updates

#### 8.1 Regular Tasks
