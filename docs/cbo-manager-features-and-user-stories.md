# CBO Manager Dashboard Implementation Plan
## Feature: Unique User Role Login Dashboard Experience

### Project Overview
Implementing role-based dashboard experiences for the Community-Based Procurement Platform (CBPP). This document outlines the plan for implementing the CBO Manager role dashboard and navigation system.

### Current State
- Default dashboard and navigation designed for Administrator role
- Single route structure (`/app/...`) for all users
- Generic navigation menu for all user types

### Target State
- Role-based routing (`/cbo-manager/...`, `/admin/...`, etc.)
- Unique dashboard experiences for each user role
- Role-specific navigation menus and page access
- Personalized user experience based on role requirements
