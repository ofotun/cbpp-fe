# Super Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan
## Feature: Comprehensive System Administration Dashboard Experience

### Project Overview
Implementing a comprehensive super admin dashboard experience for the Community-Based Procurement Platform (CBPP). This document outlines the plan for implementing the Super Admin role dashboard and navigation system, which provides access to all system functions and user role capabilities.

### Current State
- Super admin routes directly to `/app` after login
- Access to all general system pages and functions
- No dedicated super admin folder structure
- Generic navigation menu shared with other admin roles

### Target State
- Dedicated super admin routing (`/super-admin/...`)
- Comprehensive dashboard with access to all user role functions
- Role assumption capabilities for system administration
- Advanced system monitoring and management tools
- Unified control center for all platform operations
